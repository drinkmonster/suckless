# suckless
My new suckless dotfiles including st, dwm, slstatus.
- Dwm has barpadding and fullgaps patch
- St is Luke Smith's build with the font modified to Monocraft
- Rofi and St are compatible with pywal, but I set dwm manually to avoid patching more
- I also included the wallpaper I use, and my rofi config(it's basically just pywal compatibility)
